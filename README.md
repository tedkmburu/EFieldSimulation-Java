## Overview
This is an interactive simulation project designed to visualize electric fields created by point charges. Using the Processing framework along with the ControlP5 library for user interface elements, the simulation demonstrates various physical phenomena such as field lines, field vectors, equipotential lines, and voltage gradients.

## Current Status
This project is currently a work in progress. The submitted code serves as proof of concept, demonstrating that the simulation engine and basic interactive controls have been implemented. Further development is planned to refine the simulation, enhance the user interface, and add more features.

## Features
- **Electric Field Simulation:** Visualizes electric fields generated by point charges.
- **Interactive Visualization Modes:**
    - Field Lines
    - Field Vectors
    - Equipotential Lines
    - Voltage Gradients
- **Predefined Configurations:** Includes multiple preset configurations (e.g., single charge, dipole, row, dipole row, and random setups).
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with the simulation via mouse events to add, move, and modify charges.
- **Testing:** Basic JUnit tests are provided to ensure core simulation functionalities work as expected.

## Future Work
- Enhance the accuracy and performance of the simulation algorithms.
- Improve the graphical user interface and overall user experience.
- Expand the range of visualization options and charge configuration presets.
- Refine the test suite and documentation.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or later)**
- **Processing Library** – for rendering the simulation
- **ControlP5 Library** – for building the UI controls
- **JUnit** – for running the provided tests

## Setup and Running the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Add Dependencies:**
    - Ensure the Processing and ControlP5 libraries are added to your project’s build path.
3. **Compile the Project:**
    - Use your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or command-line tools to compile the project.
4. **Run the Application:**
    - Execute the `Main` class located in the `org.example` package.
5. **Interact:**
    - Use the on-screen controls to explore different simulation modes and configurations.
